# CakePHP Markdown docs

This is a proof of concept project for converting CakePHP's RST documentation format to Markdown.

**Note: This project is not affiliated with the core CakePHP team.**

## Overview

This project demonstrates the feasibility of migrating CakePHP's documentation from reStructuredText (RST) to Markdown format, making it more accessible and easier to work with modern documentation tools.

## Example

The converted markdown files have been integrated into a VitePress site for demonstration purposes. You can view the result here:

## Conversion Script

The main conversion is happening with pandoc with a bunch of added filters to make Sphinx conversion work.

*Note: This conversion script was carefully prompted and generated by AI.*

## Purpose

- Evaluate the conversion process from RST to Markdown
- Test compatibility with modern static site generators
- Explore improved documentation workflows and tooling

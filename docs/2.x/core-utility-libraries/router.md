# Router

Router can be used to parse URLs into arrays containing indexes for
the controller, action, and any parameters, and the opposite: to
convert URL arrays (eg. `array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index')`) to string URLs.

Read more about ways to [configure the Router](../development/routing#routes-configuration) and
the `Router` class.

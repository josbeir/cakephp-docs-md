# Security

`class` **Security**

The [security library](https://api.cakephp.org/2.x/class-Security.html)
handles basic security measures such as providing methods for
hashing and encrypting data.

> [!NOTE]
> By default the encryption features offered by Security rely on the deprecated
> `mcrypt` extension.
> This behaviour can be changed by setting `Security.useOpenSsl`.
> If you are using the default behaviour using PHP\>=7.1 you will need to
> install `mcrypt` via PECL.

## Security API

> rtype  
> string
>
> Encrypts/Decrypts text using the given key:
>
> ``` php
> // Encrypt your text with my_key
> $secret = Security::cipher('hello world', 'my_key');
>
> // Later decrypt your text
> $nosecret = Security::cipher($secret, 'my_key');
> ```
>
> > [!WARNING]
> > `cipher()` uses a **weak** XOR cipher and should **not** be used.
> > It is only included for backwards compatibility.
>
> param string \$text  
> The text to encrypt
>
> param string \$key  
> The key to use for encryption. This must be longer than
> 32 bytes.
>
> param string \$mode  
> The mode to use, either 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'
>
> Encrypts/Decrypts text using the rijndael-256 cipher. This requires the
> [mcrypt extension](https://www.php.net/mcrypt) to be installed:
>
> ``` php
> // Encrypt some data.
> $encrypted = Security::rijndael('a secret', Configure::read('Security.key'), 'encrypt');
>
> // Later decrypt it.
> $decrypted = Security::rijndael($encrypted, Configure::read('Security.key'), 'decrypt');
> ```
>
> `rijndael()` can be used to store data you need to decrypt later, like the
> contents of cookies. It should **never** be used to store passwords.
> Instead you should use the one way hashing methods provided by
> `~Security::hash()`

> param string \$plain  
> The value to encrypt.
>
> param string \$key  
> The 256 bit/32 byte key to use as a cipher key.
>
> param string \$hmacSalt  
> The salt to use for the HMAC process. Leave null to use Security.salt.
>
> Encrypt `$text` using AES-256. The `$key` should be a value with a
> lots of variance in the data, much like a good password. The returned result
> will be the encrypted value with an HMAC checksum.
>
> This method should **never** be used to store passwords. Instead you should
> use the one way hashing methods provided by `~Security::hash()`.
> An example use would be:
>
> ``` php
> // Assuming key is stored somewhere it can be re-used for
> // decryption later.
> $key = 'wt1U5MACWJFTXGenFoZoiLwQGrLgdbHA';
> $result = Security::encrypt($value, $key);
> ```
>
> Encrypted values can be decrypted using `Security::decrypt()`.

>
> ``` php
> // Create a hash using bcrypt
> Security::setHash('blowfish');
> $hash = Security::hash('CakePHP Framework');

> $newHash = Security::hash($newPassword, 'blowfish', $storedPassword);
> ```
>
> When comparing values hashed with bcrypt, the original hash should be
> provided as the `$salt` parameter. This allows bcrypt to reuse the same
> cost and salt values, allowing the generated hash to return the same
> resulting hash, given the same input value.

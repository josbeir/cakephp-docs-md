# 5.0 Upgrade Guide

First, check that your application is running on latest CakePHP 4.x version.

## Fix Deprecation Warnings

Once your application is running on latest CakePHP 4.x, enable deprecation warnings in **config/app.php**

```
'Error' => [
    'errorLevel' => E_ALL,
]

```

Now that you can see all the warnings, make sure these are fixed before proceeding with the upgrade.

Some potentially impactful deprecations you should make sure you have addressed
are:

- `Table::query()` was deprecated in 4.5.0. Use `selectQuery()`,
  `updateQuery()`, `insertQuery()` and `deleteQuery()` instead.

## Upgrade to PHP 8.1

If you are not running on **PHP 8.1 or higher**, you will need to upgrade PHP before updating CakePHP.

> [!NOTE]
> CakePHP 5.0 requires **a minimum of PHP 8.1**.

## Use the Upgrade Tool

> [!NOTE]
> The upgrade tool only works on applications running on latest CakePHP 4.x. You cannot run the upgrade tool after updating to CakePHP 5.0.
>

Because CakePHP 5 leverages union types and `mixed`, there are many
backwards incompatible changes concerning method signatures and file renames.
To help expedite fixing these tedious changes there is an upgrade CLI tool:

```bash
# Install the upgrade tool
git clone https://github.com/cakephp/upgrade
cd upgrade
git checkout 5.x
composer install --no-dev

```

With the upgrade tool installed you can now run it on your application or
plugin

```html
bin/cake upgrade rector --rules cakephp50 <path/to/app/src>
bin/cake upgrade rector --rules chronos3 <path/to/app/src>

```

## Update CakePHP Dependency

After applying rector refactorings you need to upgrade CakePHP, its plugins, PHPUnit
and maybe other dependencies in your `composer.json`.
This process heavily depends on your application so we recommend you compare your
`composer.json` with what is present in [cakephp/app](https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/5.x/composer.json).

After the version strings are adjusted in your `composer.json` execute
`composer update -W` and check its output.

## Update app files based upon latest app template

Next, ensure the rest of your application has been updated to be based upon the
latest version of [cakephp/app](https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/5.x/).

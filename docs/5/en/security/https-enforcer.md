# HTTPS Enforcer Middleware

If you want your application to only be available via HTTPS connections you can
use the `HttpsEnforcerMiddleware`

```php
use Cake\Http\Middleware\HttpsEnforcerMiddleware;

// Always raise an exception and never redirect.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'redirect' => false,
]);

// Send a 302 status code when redirecting
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'redirect' => true,
    'statusCode' => 302,
]);

// Send additional headers in the redirect response.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'headers' => ['X-Https-Upgrade' => 1],
]);

// Disable HTTPs enforcement when `debug` is on.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'disableOnDebug' => true,
]);

// Only trust HTTP_X_ headers from the listed servers.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'trustProxies' => ['192.168.1.1'],
]);

```

If a non-HTTP request is received that does not use GET a `BadRequestException` will be raised.

NOTE: The Strict-Transport-Security header is ignored by the browser when your site has only been 
accessed using HTTP. Once your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser 
knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the Strict-Transport-Security header.

## Adding Strict-Transport-Security

When your application requires SSL it is a good idea to set the
`Strict-Transport-Security` header. This header value is cached in the
browser, and informs browsers that they should always connect with HTTPS connections.
You can configure this header with the `hsts` option

```php
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'hsts' => [
        // How long the header value should be cached for.
        'maxAge' => 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
        // should this policy apply to subdomains?
        'includeSubDomains' => true,
        // Should the header value be cacheable in google's HSTS preload
        // service? While not part of the spec it is widely implemented.
        'preload' => true,
    ],
]);

```

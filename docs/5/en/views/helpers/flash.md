**Namespace:** `Cake\View\Helper`

### Class `Cake\View\Helper\FlashHelper(View $view, array $config = [])`

FlashHelper provides a way to render flash messages that were set in
`$_SESSION` by [FlashComponent](../../controllers/components/flash.md).
[FlashComponent](../../controllers/components/flash.md) and FlashHelper
primarily use elements to render flash messages.  Flash elements are found under
the **templates/element/flash** directory.  You'll notice that CakePHP's App
template comes with three flash elements: **success.php**, **default.php**, and
**error.php**.

## Rendering Flash Messages

To render a flash message, you can simply use FlashHelper's `render()`
method in your template file

```php
<?= $this->Flash->render() ?>

```

By default, CakePHP uses a "flash" key for flash messages in a session.  But, if
you've specified a key when setting the flash message in
[FlashComponent](../../controllers/components/flash.md), you can specify which
flash key to render

```php
<?= $this->Flash->render('other') ?>

```

You can also override any of the options that were set in FlashComponent::

```php
// In your Controller
$this->Flash->set('The user has been saved.', [
    'element' => 'success'
]);

// In your template file: Will use great_success.php instead of success.php
<?= $this->Flash->render('flash', [
    'element' => 'great_success'
]);

// In your template file: the flashy element file from the Company Plugin
<?= $this->Flash->render('flash', [
    'element' => 'Company.flashy'
]);

```

> [!NOTE]
> When building custom flash message templates, be sure to properly HTML
> encode any user data. CakePHP won't escape flash message parameters for you.
>

For more information about the available array options, please refer to the
[FlashComponent](../../controllers/components/flash.md) section.

## Routing Prefix and Flash Messages

If you have a Routing prefix configured, you can now have your Flash elements
stored in **templates/{Prefix}/element/flash**. This way, you can have
specific messages layouts for each part of your application. For instance, using
different layouts for your front-end and admin section.

## Flash Messages and Themes

The FlashHelper uses normal elements to render the messages and will therefore
obey any theme you might have specified. So when your theme has a
**templates/element/flash/error.php** file it will be used, just as with any
Elements and Views.

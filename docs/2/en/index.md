The CakePHP cookbook is an openly developed and community editable documentation

the documentation. Notice the "Improve this Doc" button in the upper right-hand
corner; it will direct you to the GitHub online editor of the active page,
allowing you to easily contribute any additions, deletions, or corrections to
the documentation.

## Getting Started

### Build a Blog

Get started with the [blog tutorial](tutorials-and-examples/blog/blog.md).
You'll learn the basics of CakePHP, and build a basic blog in the process.

### Conventions

Learn about a typical [CakePHP request](getting-started/a-typical-cakephp-request.md) and the [conventions](getting-started/cakephp-conventions.md) that power CakePHP.

### Controllers

Controllers handle requests and help co-ordinate and prepare
responses for the client. Read more about [/controllers`.

### Views

Views are the presentation layer in CakePHP. They convert
the data fetched from Models into the output format requested by the
client. Read more about [views](views.md).

### Models

Models are the heart of your application. They handle the validation,
storage and retrieval of your data. Read more about [models](models.md).

## Getting Help

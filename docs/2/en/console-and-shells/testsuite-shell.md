# Test shell

Once you've started writing [Tests](../development/testing.md) you can run them
using the test shell.

For more information on basic usage of the test shell see
[run-tests-from-command-line](../development/testing.md#run-tests-from-command-line).
> **versionchanged:** 2.1
The `test` shell was added in 2.1. The 2.0 `testsuite` shell is still
available but the new syntax is preferred.

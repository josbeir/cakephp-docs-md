# Shell Helpers

Shell Helpers let you package up complex output generation code. Shell
Helpers can be accessed and used from any shell or task

```php
// Output some data as a table.
$this->helper('table')->output($data);

// Get a helper from a plugin.
$this->helper('Plugin.HelperName')->output($data);

```

You can also get instances of helpers and call any public methods on them::

```php
// Get and use the Progress Helper.
$progress = $this->helper('Progress');
$progress->increment(10);
$progress->draw();

```

## Creating Helpers

While CakePHP comes with a few shell helpers you can create more in your
application or plugins. As an example, we'll create a simple helper to generate
fancy headings. First create the **app/Console/Helper/HeadingHelper.php** and put
the following in it

```php
<?php
App::uses("BaseShellHelper", "Console/Helper");

class HeadingHelper extends BaseShellHelper
{
    public function output($args)
    {
        $args += array('', '#', 3);
        $marker = str_repeat($args[1], $args[2]);
        $this->_consoleOutput->out($marker . ' ' . $args[0] . ' ' . $marker);
    }
}

```

We can then use this new helper in one of our shell commands by calling it::

```php
// With ### on either side
$this->helper('heading')->output('It works!');

// With ~~~~ on either side
$this->helper('heading')->output('It works!', '~', 4);

```

## Built-In Helpers

### Table Helper

The TableHelper assists in making well formatted ASCII art tables. Using it is
pretty simple

```php
$data = array(
    array('Header 1', 'Header', 'Long Header'),
    array('short', 'Longish thing', 'short'),
    array('Longer thing', 'short', 'Longest Value'),
);
$this->helper('table')->output($data);

// Outputs
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header 1 | Header | Long Header |
| short Longer thing | Longish thing short | short Longest Value |

```

### Progress Helper

The ProgressHelper can be used in two different ways. The simple mode lets you
provide a callback that is invoked until the progress is complete

```php
$this->helper('progress')->output(function ($progress) {
    // Do work here.
    $progress->increment(20);
});

```

You can control the progress bar more by providing additional options:

- `total` The total number of items in the progress bar. Defaults
  to 100.
- `width` The width of the progress bar. Defaults to 80.
- `callback` The callback that will be called in a loop to advance the
  progress bar.

An example of all the options in use would be

```php
$this->helper('progress')->output(array(
    'total' => 10,
    'width' => 20,
    'callback' => function ($progress) {
        $progress->increment(2);
    }
));

```

The progress helper can also be used manually to increment and re-render the
progress bar as necessary

```php
$progress = $this->helper('Progress');
$progress->init(array(
    'total' => 10,
    'width' => 20,
));

$progress->increment(4);
$progress->draw();

```

# Core Libraries

CakePHP comes with a plethora of built-in functions and classes. These classes
and functions try to cover some of the most common features required in web
applications.

## General Purpose

General purpose libraries are available and reused in many places across
CakePHP.

- [General Purpose](core-libraries/toc-general-purpose.md)

## Behaviors

Behaviors add extra functionality to your models. CakePHP comes
with a number of built-in behaviors such as `TreeBehavior`
and `ContainableBehavior`.

To learn about creating and using behaviors, read the section
on [Behaviors](models/behaviors.md).

## Components

CakePHP has a selection of components to help take care of basic tasks in your
controllers. See the section on [Components](controllers/components.md) for how to
configure and use components.

## Helpers

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation. They assist in
creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid in formatting text, times and
numbers, and can even integrate with popular JavaScript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers.

Read [Helpers](views/helpers.md) to learn more about helpers, their API, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.

## Utilities

Beyond the core MVC components, CakePHP includes a great selection of utility
classes that help you do everything from webservice requests, to caching, to
logging, internationalization and more.

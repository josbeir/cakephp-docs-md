# Core Libraries

CakePHP comes with a plethora of built-in functions and classes. These classes
and functions try to cover some of the most common features required in web
applications.

## General Purpose

General purpose libraries are available and reused in many places across
CakePHP.

<!-- anchor: core-behaviors -->
## Behaviors
<!--@include: core-libraries/toc-behaviors.md{3,}-->

<!-- anchor: core-components -->
## Components
<!--@include: core-libraries/toc-components.md{3,}-->

<!-- anchor: core-helpers -->
## Helpers
<!--@include: core-libraries/toc-helpers.md{3,}-->

## Utilities

Beyond the core MVC components, CakePHP includes a great selection of utility
classes that help you do everything from webservice requests, to caching, to
logging, internationalization and more.

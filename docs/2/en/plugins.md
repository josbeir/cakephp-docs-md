# Plugins

CakePHP allows you to set up a combination of controllers, models,
and views and release them as a packaged application plugin that
others can use in their CakePHP applications. Have a sweet user
management module, simple blog, or web services module in one of
your applications? Package it as a CakePHP plugin so you can pop it
into other applications.

The main tie between a plugin and the application it has been
installed into, is the application's configuration (database
connection, etc.). Otherwise, it operates in its own little space,
behaving much like it would if it were an application on its own.

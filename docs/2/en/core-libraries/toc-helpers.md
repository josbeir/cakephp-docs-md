# Helpers

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation. They assist in
creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid in formatting text, times and
numbers, and can even integrate with popular JavaScript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers.

Read [Helpers](../views/helpers.md) to learn more about helpers, their API, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.

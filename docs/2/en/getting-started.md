# Getting Started

The CakePHP framework provides a robust base for your application.
It can handle every aspect, from the user's initial request all the
way to the final rendering of a web page. And since the framework
follows the principles of MVC, it allows you to easily customize
and extend most aspects of your application.

The framework also provides a basic organizational structure, from
filenames to database table names, keeping your entire application
consistent and logical. This concept is simple but powerful. Follow
the conventions and you'll always know exactly where things are and
how they're organized.

The best way to experience and learn CakePHP is to sit down and build something.
To start off we'll build a simple blog application.

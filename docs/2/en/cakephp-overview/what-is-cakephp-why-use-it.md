# What is CakePHP? Why use it?

[CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/) is a
[free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License),
[open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source),
[rapid development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development)
[framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework)
for [PHP](https://www.php.net/). It's a foundational structure for
programmers to create web applications. Our primary goal is to
enable you to work in a structured and rapid mannerâ€“without loss of
flexibility.

CakePHP takes the monotony out of web development. It provides you
with all the tools you need to get started coding and what you
need to get done: the logic specific to your application. Instead
of reinventing the wheel every time you begin a new project,
check out a copy of CakePHP and get started with the logic of
your application.

CakePHP has an active
[developer team](https://github.com/cakephp?tab=members)
and community, bringing great value to the project. In addition to
keeping you from wheel-reinventing, using CakePHP means your
application's core is well tested and is being constantly
improved.

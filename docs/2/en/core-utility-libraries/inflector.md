# Inflector

`class` **Inflector**

The Inflector class takes a string and can manipulate it to handle
word variations such as pluralizations or camelizing and is
normally accessed statically. Example:
`Inflector::pluralize('example')` returns "examples".

You can try out the inflections online at
[inflector.cakephp.org](https://inflector.cakephp.org/).

# Schema Cache Shell

The SchemaCacheShell provides a simple CLI tool for managing your application's
metadata caches. In deployment situations it is helpful to rebuild the metadata
cache in-place without clearing the existing cache data. You can do this by
running

```
bin/cake schema_cache build --connection default

```

This will rebuild the metadata cache for all tables on the `default`
connection. If you only need to rebuild a single table you can do that by
providing its name

```
bin/cake schema_cache build --connection default articles

```

In addition to building cached data, you can use the SchemaCacheShell to remove
cached metadata as well

```bash
# Clear all metadata
bin/cake schema_cache clear

# Clear a single table
bin/cake schema_cache clear articles

```

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to 3.6 you should use `orm_cache` instead of `schema_cache`.

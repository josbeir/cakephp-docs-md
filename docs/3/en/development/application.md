# Application

The `Application` is the heart of your application. It controls
how your application is configured, and what plugins, middleware, console
commands and routes are included.

You can find your `Application` class at **src/Application.php**. By default
it will be pretty slim and only define a few default
[Middleware](../controllers/middleware.md). Applications can define the following hook
methods:

- `bootstrap` Used to load [configuration files](../development/configuration.md), define constants and other global functions.
  By default this will include **config/bootstrap.php**. This is the ideal place
  to load [Plugins](../plugins.md) and global [event listeners](../core-libraries/events.md).
- `routes` Used to load [routes](../development/routing.md). By default this
  will include **config/routes.php**.
- `middleware` Used to add [middleware](../controllers/middleware.md) to your application.
- `console` Used to add [console commands](../console-and-shells.md) to your
  application. By default this will automatically discover shells & commands in
  your application and all plugins.

## Adding the new HTTP Stack to an Existing Application

Using the Application class and HTTP Middleware in an existing application
requires a few changes to your code.

1.  First update your **webroot/index.php**. Copy the file contents from the [app
    skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.x/webroot/index.php).
2.  Create an `Application` class. See the [Using Middleware](#using-middleware) section
    above for how to do that. Or copy the example in the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.x/src/Application.php).
3.  Create **config/requirements.php** if it doesn't exist and add the contents
    from the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/3.x/config/requirements.php).
4.  Add the `_cake_routes_` cache definition to **config/app.php**, if it is
    not already there.
5.  Update **config/bootstrap.php** and **config/bootstrap_cli.php**
    as per the [app_skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.x/config/bootstrap.php),
    being careful to preserve whatever additions and changes are specific to
    your application. The bootstrap.php updates include
    - Disabling the `_cake_routes_` cache in development mode
    - Removing the requirements section (now in **config/requirements.php**)
    - Removing DebugKit plugin loading (now in **src/Application.php**)
    - Removing the **autoload.php** import (now in **webroot/index.php**)
    - Removing `DispatcherFactory` references
6.  Update the contents of the files in **bin**. Replace the files with the
    versions from the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.x/bin).
7.  If you are using the `CsrfProtectionMiddleware` make sure you remove the
    `CsrfComponent` from your controllers.

Once those steps are complete you are ready to start re-implementing any
application/plugin dispatch filters as HTTP middleware.

If you are running tests you will also need to update your
**tests/bootstrap.php** by copying the file contents from the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.x/tests/bootstrap.php).

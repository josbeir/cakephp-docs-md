# HTTPS Enforcer Middleware

If you want your application to only be available via HTTPS connections you can
use the `HttpsEnforcerMiddleware`:

``` php
use Cake\Http\Middleware\HttpsEnforcerMiddleware;

// Always raise an exception and never redirect.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'redirect' => false,
]);

// Send a 302 status code when redirecting
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'redirect' => true,
    'statusCode' => 302,
]);

// Send additional headers in the redirect response.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'headers' => ['X-Https-Upgrade' => 1],
]);

// Disable HTTPs enforcement when ``debug`` is on.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'disableOnDebug' => true,
]);

// Only trust HTTP_X_ headers from the listed servers.
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'trustProxies' => ['192.168.1.1'],
]);
```

If a non-HTTP request is received that does not use GET a `BadRequestException` will be raised.

## Adding Strict-Transport-Security

When your application requires SSL it is a good idea to set the
`Strict-Transport-Security` header. This header value is cached in the
browser, and informs browsers that they should always connect with HTTPS connections.
You can configure this header with the `hsts` option:

``` php
$https = new HttpsEnforcerMiddleware([
    'hsts' => [
        // How long the header value should be cached for.
        'maxAge' => 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
        // should this policy apply to subdomains?
        'includeSubDomains' => true,
        // Should the header value be cacheable in google's HSTS preload
        // service? While not part of the spec it is widely implemented.
        'preload' => true,
    ],
]);
```

# 4.5 Migration Guide

CakePHP 4.5 is an API compatible upgrade from 4.0. This page outlines the
deprecations and features added in 4.5.

## Upgrading to 4.5.0

You can can use composer to upgrade to CakePHP 4.5.0:

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:4.5.x"

> [!NOTE]
> CakePHP 4.5 requires PHP 7.4 or greater.

## Deprecations

4.5 introduces a few deprecations. All of these features will continue for the
duration of 4.x but will be removed in 5.0.

You can use the [upgrade tool](#upgrade-tool-use) to automate updating
usage of deprecated features:

    bin/cake upgrade rector --rules cakephp45 <path/to/app/src>

> [!NOTE]
> This only updates CakePHP 4.5 changes. Make sure you apply CakePHP 4.4 changes first.

A new configuration option has been added to disable deprecations on a path by
path basis. See [Deprecation Warnings](../development/errors#deprecation-warnings) for more information.

### ORM Query API deprecations

There are some potentially impactful changes to the ORM coming in 5.x. To make
querybuilding more typesafe and have fewer silent errors 5.x will be
transitioning to separate query objects for each type of query. The new classes
are:

- `Cake\ORM\Query\DeleteQuery` Used for building `delete` queries.
- `Cake\ORM\Query\InsertQuery` Used for building `insert` queries.
- `Cake\ORM\Query\SelectQuery` Used for building `select` queries.
- `Cake\ORM\Query\UpdateQuery` Used for building `update` queries.

Each of these classes lack methods that don't make sense for that query type.
For example, `DeleteQuery` has no `select()` clause, and `InsertQuery` has
no `limit()` method. 5.x will also offer new `*query()` methods on `Table`
to replace `query()`.

The 4.5 release also introduces these new query classes and methods on
`Table` to provide an opt-in upgrade path. In 4.5, the new query classes are
sub-classes of `ORM\Query` and have full backwards compatibility, but they
also emit deprecations from all methods that will **not** be present in 5.x.

When upgrading you can upgrade to the new query classes by replacing calls to
`Table::query()`. Replacing it are new methods on `Table`. The
`deleteQuery()`, `insertQuery()`, `selectQuery()`, `updateQuery()`
methods will returrn the new query instances which will emit deprecations if you
are using the new classes incorrectly.

Our hope is that these methods will allow you to incrementally adopt the new
APIs that will exist in the future.

### Http

- Calling `ServerRequest::is()` with an unknown detector will now raise an
  exception.
- HTTP Digest authentication in `Client` now supports `SHA-256`,
  `SHA-512-256` and `-sess` algorithms.

### Log

- `FileLog` will now create missing directories even when debug mode is false.

### ORM

- In CakePHP 5 `EntityTrait::has()` will return true when an attribute exists
  and is set to null. Depending on your application this can lead to unexpected
  behavior with your existing code. Use `EntityTrait::hasValue()` to
  check if a field contains a 'non-empty' value.
- `Table::_initializeSchema()` is deprecated. Override `getSchema()`
  instead, or re-map columns in `initialize()`.
- `QueryInterface::repository()` is deprecated. Use `setRepository()`
  instead.
- `Query::selectAlso()` was added.

### Routing

- The `_ssl` option for `Router::url()` has been deprecated. Use `_https`
  instead. HTTPs is no longer entirely based on `ssl`, and this rename aligns
  the CakePHP parameters with the broader web.
- `Router::routes()` and `RouteCollection::routes()` return routes in
  a different order than previous versions of CakePHP. If your application
  uses these methods and then accesses specific indexes you will need to update
  your code.

### Validation

- `Validator::isArray()` is deprecated. Use `Validator::array()` instead.

### View

- It is recommended to replace `loadHelper()` with new `addHelper()` method
  to add helpers in `View::initialize()`.

## New Features

### Cache

- `Cache::write()` will now throw an exception on error.

### Console

- `ConsoleOptionParser` now treats all input after a `--` as positional
  arguments. This allows console commands to accept positional arguments that
  begin with a `-` such as date values like `-1 day`.
- `bin/cake cache clear_group <name>` was added. This command gives a CLI
  interface to clearing a specific cache group. See [Cache Groups](../core-libraries/caching#cache-groups) for how
  to use cache groups.

### Controller

- `ComponentRegistry` is now automatically added to your application's
  `DI container`.
- `Controller::addViewClasses()` was added. This method lets you build
  a controller's view classes programatically.

### Console

- Using `--` on the command line to separate options and positional arguments is now supported.

### Core

- The current container instance is now registered in the `DI container`
  and available as dependency for application services or controllers/commands.

### Database

- `ConnectionManager` now supports read and write connection roles. Roles can
  be configured with `read` and `write` keys in the connection config that
  override the shared config.
- `ConnectionManager::aliases()` was added.
- `SelectQuery::setConnectionRole()`, `SelectQuery::useReadRole()`, and
  `SelectQuery::useWriteRole()` were added to let you switch a query to
  a specific connection role.

### Datasource

- `ModelAwareTrait::loadModel()` is no longer deprecated. This method is used
  extensively in user-land applications and had no real replacement. Usage of
  dynamic-properties & `loadModel()` will continue to emit deprecation errors
  though.
- `ModelAwareTrait::fetchModel()` was added. This method works similar to
  `loadModel()` but does not set the model as an attribute.
- `NumericPaginator` no longer applies all pagination options as query
  options. Instead pagination specific options will be unset from the options
  data that is passed to ORM queries.

### Error

- The development error page design has been improved. It now renders chained
  exceptions and makes navigating stack traces easier as each frame can be
  collapsed individually.
- Console exception messages now include stack traces for chained exceptions.
- Listeners of the `Exception.beforeRender` event can now replace the trapped
  exception or override the rendering step by returning a `Response` object.
- Listeners of the `Error.beforeRender` event can now replace the rendering
  step for an error by returning the desired output.

### Http

- The `HttpsEnforcerMiddleware` now supports a `trustedProxies` option that
  lets you define which proxies your application trusts.
- `MiddlewareQueue` can now resolve services from the DI container when
  creating middleware based on classnames.
- `SessionCsrfMiddleware::replaceToken()` was added to enable scenarios where
  CSRF tokens need to be rotated.

### I18n

- Plugins can now use multiple domain files for translations. You can load
  reference additional translation domains with <span class="title-ref">plugin_name.domain</span>. For
  example `__d('DebugKit.errors', 'oh no')`.

### ORM

`EntityTrait::$_hasAllowsNull` was added. This property allows you to
incrementally opt-in to a breaking change present in 5.x for `EntityTrait::has()`.
When set to true, this property will make `has()` and related methods use
`array_key_exists` instead of `isset` to decide if fields are 'defined' in an
entity. This will affect code like:

``` php
if ($user->has('name')) { 
    // More logic
}
```

In 4.x this condition would **fail** if `name` was `null`. However, in 5.0,
this will condition will now **pass**. You can prepare your application for this
change by incrementally setting `$_hasAllowsNull`.

### TestSuite

- `Cake\TestSuite\Fixture\SchemaLoader::loadInternalFile()` is no longer an
  internal method. This method is now available to plugin authors as a path to
  migrate off of defining schema in fixture classes where migrations are not
  already in use.
- `IntegrationTestTrait::assertCookieIsSet()` was added.

### Utility

- `Hash::normalize()` now has a `$default` parameter that is used for the
  value of keys that had numeric keys in the input array.

### View

- `View::addHelper()` was added. This method compliments `addBehavior()` and
  `addComponent()`.
- `FormHelper` now supports a `requiredClass` template. This template
  defines the required classname used when generating controls.

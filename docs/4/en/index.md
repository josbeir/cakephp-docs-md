## Getting Help

If you're stuck, there are a number of places [you can get help](intro/where-to-get-help.md).

## First Steps

Learning a new framework can be intimidating and exciting at the same time. To
help you along, we have created a cookbook packed with examples and recipes to
get the common tasks completed. If you are new, you should start off with the
[/quickstart](quickstart.md) as it will give you a quick tour of what
CakePHP has to offer and how it works.

After you've finished the Quickstart tutorial, you can brush up on the key
elements in a CakePHP application:

- The [CakePHP request cycle](#request-cycle)
- The [conventions](intro/conventions.md) that CakePHP
  uses.
- [Controllers](controllers.md) handle requests and co-ordinate your models
  and the responses your application creates.
- [Views](views.md) are the presentation layer in your application. They
  give you powerful tools to create HTML, JSON and the other outputs your
  application needs.
- [Models](orm.md) are the key ingredient in any application. They handle
  validation, and domain logic within your application.

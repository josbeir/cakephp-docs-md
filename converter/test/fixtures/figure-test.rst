Figure Directive Test
===================

Here's a figure with alt text and align:

.. figure:: //typical-cake-request.png
:align: center
:alt: Flow diagram showing a typical CakePHP request

This shows how CakePHP processes requests.

Another Figure
--------------

.. figure:: //validation-cycle.png
:align: left
:alt: Flow diagram showing the marshalling/validation process.

This shows the validation process.

Simple Figure
-------------

.. figure:: //save-cycle.png

Just a basic figure without options.

Regular Image
-------------

.. image:: /static/img/example.png

This is a regular image directive.

Quirks Test
===========

This document tests various quirks that need to be fixed:

The add<registry-object>() method is useful.

You should use proper <p> around your content and <br> where needed.

Check the <td>-attributes when working with tables.

The <tr> attributes are also important inside of <table> elements.

Also test <locale> placeholder replacement.
